trademapper-js
==============

Javascript application and libraries for mapping international trade using
[d3.js](http://d3js.org/)  It runs in the browser, and you can import data
from CSV files, view the trade on the map, filter by various columns, and
zoom and pan around the resulting map.

What is TradeMapper?
--------------------

The illegal trade in wildlife threatens some of our planetâ€™s most iconic
species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants, and evolves rapidly; taking
advantage of new routes and other opportunities to avoid detection. To
understand and manage the ever-changing trade effectively, scientists and
conservationists need to work with large volumes of data that describe
international movement of wildlife and wildlife products (like ivory and rhino
horn). This helps them understand the spatial patterns of trade, and determine
what factors are influencing it and how these can be addressed.  These findings
then need to be communicated clearly and effectively with decision-makers and
the public.  Only then can solutions be found, and wildlife protected.

To help, we built TradeMapper: an open source interactive browser-based tool
that maps international wildlife trade flow data, allowing users to visualise
the global trade in wildlife.  TradeMapper offers a way to explore trends, both
historical and geographical, in a way that is simply impossible when dealing
with dry numerical data in a spreadsheet.

But ultimately, TradeMapper is not limited to wildlife data - it can map
international trade of any variety.

Docker usage
-------------

From the root directory run docker build -t trademapper:0.1 . to build the container image; run docker run -d -p 80:80 trademapper:0.1 to start the container .

Remember any changes to the codebase will require a new docker build and new docker run ( remember to kill the previosu container )
